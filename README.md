## Introduction

## Basic Structure

A rule list for Consent-O-Matic is a JSON structure that contains the rules for detecting a CMP (Consent Management Provider), and
dealing with the CMP popup when it is detected.

It contains 2 parts, `detectors` and `methods`.

```
{
   "detectors": [ ... ],
   "methods": [ ... ]
}
```

### Detectors

Detectors are the part that detects if a certain rule set should be applied. Basically, if a detector triggers, the methods will be applied.

Detector structure:
```
{
   "presentMatcher": { ... },
   "showingMatcher": { ... }
}
```

The present matcher is used to detect if the CMP is present on the page.

Some CMPs still insert the popup HTML into the DOM even when re-visiting a page where you have already given consent earlier. We only want to handle the consent form if its actually showing on the page. This is what the showing matcher is used for.

Both the present and showing matcher follow the common structure of [`Matchers`](#matchers).

### Methods

Methods are collections of actions. There are 3 methods supported by Consent-O-Matic. `OPEN_OPTIONS`, `DO_CONSENT`, `SAVE_CONSENT`

All the methods are optional, and if present the methods will be run in the order given above, when a detector is triggered.

Methods take on the form:
```
{
   "name": " ... ",
   "action": { ... }
}
```

Where the name is one of the 3 supported methods, and action is the [action](#actions) to execute.

## DOM Selection

Most actions and matchers have some target that they apply to. For this reason Consent-O-Matic has a DOM selection mechanism that can easily help with selecting the correct dom element.

```json
"parent": {
   "selector": ".some.css.selector",
   "textFilter": "someTextFilter",
   "styleFilter": {
      "option": "someStyleOption",
      "value": "someStyleValue",
      "negated": false
   },
   "displayFilter": true,
   "iframeFilter": false,
   "childFilter": {}
},
"target": {
   "selector": ".some.css.selector",
   "textFilter": "someTextFilter",
   "styleFilter": {
      "option": "someStyleOption",
      "value": "someStyleValue",
      "negated": false
   },
   "displayFilter": true,
   "iframeFilter": false,
   "childFilter": {}
}
```

There are 2 parts, `parent` and `target`. The `parent` is optional, if it exists it will be resolved first, and used as the starting point for `target`.

All the parameters to `parent` and `target` except `selector` are optional.

The selection method works by using the css selector from `selector` and then filtering the resulting DOM nodes via the various filters:

`textFilter` filters all nodes that does not include the given text. It can also be given as an array `"textFilter":["filter1", "filter2"]` and then it filters all nodes that does not include one of the given text filters.

`styleFilter` filters based on computedStyles. `option` is the style option to compare for example `position`, `value` is the value to compare against and `negated` sets if the option value should match or not match the given value.

`displayFilter` can be used to filter nodes based on if they are display hidden or not.

`iframeFilter` filters nodes based on if they are inside an iframe or not.

`childFilter` is a fully new DOM selection, that then filters on the original selection, based on if a selection was made by `childFilter` or not.

Lets make an example dom selection:
```json
"parent": {
   "selector": ".myParent",
   "iframeFilter": true,
   "childFilter": {
      "target": {
         "selector": ".myChild",
         "textFilter": "Gregor"
      }
   }
},
"target": {
   "selector": ".myTarget"
}
```
This selector first tries to find the `parent` chich is a DOM element with the class `myParent` that is inside an iframe and has a child DOM element with the class `myChild` that contains the text "Gregor".

Then using this parent as "root" it tries to find a DOM element with the class `myTarget`.

This could then be the target of an action or matcher.

## Actions

Actions are the part of Consent-O-Matic that actually do stuff. Some actions do something to a target selection, others have to do with control flow.

### Click

This action simulates a mouse click on its target.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "click",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myButton",
      "textFilter": "Save settings"
   }
}
```

In this example we only use a simple `target` with a `textFilter` but full [DOM selection](#dom-selection) is supported.

### List

This action runs a list of actions in order.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "list",
   "actions": []
}
```

`actions` is an array of actions that will all be run in order.

### Consent

The consent action takes an array of consents, and tries to apply the users consent selections.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "consent",
   "consents": []
}
```

`consents` is an array of [Consent](#consent) types

### Slide

Some consent forms use a slider to set a consent level, this action supports simulating sliding with such a slider.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "slide",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".mySliderKnob"
   },
   "dragTarget": {
      "target": {
         "selector": ".myChoosenOption"
      }
   },
   "axis": "y"
}
```

`target` is the target DOM element to simulate the slide motion on.

`dragTarget` is the DOM element to use for slide distance.

`axis` selects if the slider should go horizontal "x" or vertical "y".

The slide event will simulate that the mouse dragged `target` the distance from `target` to `dragTarget` on the given `axis`.

### If Css

This action is used as control flow, running another action depending on of a DOM selection finds an element or not.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "ifcss",
   "target": {
      "selector": "",
   },
   "trueAction": {
      "type": "click",
      "target": {
         "selector": ".myTrueButton"
      }  
   },
   "falseAction": {
      "type": "click",
      "target": {
         "selector": ".myFalseButton"
      }
   }
}
```

`trueAction` is an action that will be run of the DOM selection finds an element.
`falseAction` will be run when the DOM selection does not find an element.

### Wait For Css

This action waits until the DOM selector finds a dom element that matches. Mostly used if something in the consent form loads slowly and needs to be waited for.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "waitcss",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myWaitTarget"
   },
   "retries": 10,
   "waitTime": 200
}
```

`retries` is the number of times to check for the target dom element. Deafults to 10.

`waitTime` determines the time between retry attempts. Defaults to 250.

### For Each

If some set of actions needs to be run several times, but with different DOM nodes as root, the for each action can be used. It runs its action 1 time for each DOM element that is selected by its DOM selection, all actions run inside the for each loop, will see the DOM as starting from the currently selected node.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "foreach",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".loopElement"
   },
   "action": {}
}
```

`action` is the action to run for each found DOM element.

### Hide

This action sets css property `display` to `none` on the DOM selection.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "hide",
   "target": ".myHiddenClass"
}
```

## Matchers

Matchers are used to check for the presence of some DOM selection, or the state of some DOM selection.

### Css

This matcher checks for the presence of a DOM selection, and return that it matches if it exists.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "css",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myMatchingClass"
   }
}
```

### Checkbox

This matcher checks the state of an `<input type='checkbox' />` and returns that it matches if the checkbox is checked.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "checkbox",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myInputCheckbox"
   }
}
```

## Consent

This is what is used inside [Consent Actions](#consent) and defines the actual consent that the user should be giving or not giving.

Each consent has a type, that matches the consent categories inside Consent-O-Matic, so if a user has toggled the first consent category to ON, (Type A) and the consent is of type "A", then the consent will be enabled.

Usually the consent is given either as a toggle, or a set of buttons on/off. Therefor `consent` has mechanism for both these cases.

Example:
```json
{
   "type": "A",
   "toggleAction": {},
   "matcher": {},
   "trueAction": {},
   "falseAction": {}
}
```

`type` is the type of consent category this rule defines and determines if this consent should be on or off depending on the users selection for that type of category.

`toggleAction` this action is used to select consent if a toggle type, for example a switch. The action will be run if the matcher says the consent is in a state different from what the user has asked it to be, otherwise it will not be run.

`matcher` is the matcher used to check which state the consent is in. For a [checkbox matcher](#checkbox), the consent is given if the checkbox is checked. For a [css matcher](#css) the consent is given if the matcher finds a DOM selection.

`trueAction` and `falseAction` are the actions used of the consent is given by pressing one of 2 buttons, and is not toggled. These will be run dependning on the users selection of consent. If the user has given consent for this category type, the `trueAction` will be run, and `falseAction` will be run if the user has not given consent to this category type.

If `toggleAction` and `matcher` is present on the content config, toggleAction will be used, if one of them is missing, `trueAction`/`falseAction` will be used instead.
